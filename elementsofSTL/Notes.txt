# Components of the C++ STL

1. Containers, array-like data structures that store collections of objects.
2. Iterators, pointer-like objects that allow traversal of containers.
3. Algorithms, a collection of algorithm implementations for operations, such as search and sort.
4. Functors, function objects that can be parameterized in their constructors.

Containers
 - Objects that handle a collection of objects (elements), implementing a well-defined data structure.
 Examples: vectors, stacks, queues, maps and pairs.

 3 Main types of Containers:
 1. Sequence - storage of data :: Vectors, list, deques, stacks and queues.
 2. Associative - storage of associative pairs as implemented as trees :: Sets, maps, multisets, multimaps.
 3. Unordered Associative - storage of associative implements as hash tables :: Sets, maps, multisets, multimaps.

 Sequence Containers:

 Vector, a dynamic size array.
 Supports random access for insertions and deletions of elements.
 Elements are stored contiguously in memory.
 Dynamically resizes as needed.
 There is also array.

 List, a doubly linked list.
 Does not support random access of elements.
 Elements are not stored contiguously in memory.
 Different performance than a vector.
 There is also a forward_list

 Deque, a double-ended queue
 Supports push and pop operations on both ends.
 Elements are not all stored contiguously in memory.
 Also serves as a stack or queue.

 Container Adapters:
 1. Stack - push and pop operations on 1 end. (Deque, Vector or list).
 2. Queue - push and pop operations.
 3. Priority queue - insert and get (heap).

 Associative Containers:
 Set, a mathematical set.
 Implementation
    - Ordered sets as binary trees.
    - Unordered sets as hash tables
 Does not accept duplicates.
 For duplicates, use multisets.

 Map, a set of pairs.
 Pairs are two-tuples.
 Map implementation is similar to sets.
